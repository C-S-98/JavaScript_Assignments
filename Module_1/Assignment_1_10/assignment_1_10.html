    <h1>Dice Probability Calculator</h1>
<!--
    <h2>Module 1. Interactive programs + Conditional expressions and loops
    </h2>

    <h3>
        10. Make a program that asks the user for the number of dice and the sum
        of the eye numbers of interest to the user. The purpose of your
        program is now to find out with what probability the number of dice
        given by the user produces the sum of the number of eyes given by the
        user. For example, if the user enters 3 as the number of dice and 17
        as the sum of the eyes, the program calculates the probability that
        the sum of the three dice's eye numbers is 17. (5p)
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Solve the problem by simulating: Have the program roll a given
            number of dice in a for-loop (e.g. 10,000 times) and calculate
            what proportion of the repetitions produced the sum of eye
            numbers of interest to the user.
        </li>
        <li>
            Print the result on the HTML document:
            <br>
            <hr>
            <em>Probability to get sum 7 with 2 dice is 15.64%</em>
            <hr>
        </li>
        <li>
            you can limit the number of decimals with <em>toFixed()</em>
        </li>
        <li>
            test values:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    2 dice, sum 7, probability is about 15-17%
                </li>
                <li>
                    3 dice, sum 15, probability is about 5%
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
