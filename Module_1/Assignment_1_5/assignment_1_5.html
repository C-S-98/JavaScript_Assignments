    <h3>5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a year and notifies
        the user whether the input year is a leap year. A year is a leap year
        if it is divisible by four. However, years divisible by 100 are leap
        years only if they are also divisible by 400. Print the result on the
        HTML document. (3p)
