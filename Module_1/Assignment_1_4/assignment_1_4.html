    <h1>Hogwarts Sorting Ceremony</h1>

    <h2>Module 1. Interactive programs + Conditional expressions and loops
    </h2>

    <h3>4. In the Harry Potter children's books, the sorting hat assigns a
        new student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to one of
        the four classes, which are Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and
        Ravenclaw. Write an electronic sorting hat that asks for a student's
        name and draws a room for him. If you enter Anna as the name, for
        example, the program prints to the HTML document "Anna, you are
        Ravenclaw." (3p)
    </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use math.random() to draw a value (1, 2, 3 or 4)
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the number is drawn, you need to use a multiple choice
                structure (if, else if, ..., else or switch).
            </li>
        </ul>
