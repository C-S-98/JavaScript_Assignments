           Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and itself.
        </li>
        <li>
            For example, number 13 is a prime number as it can only be
            divided by 1 or 13 so that the result is an integer.
        </li>
        <li>
            On the other hand, number 21 for example is not a prime number as
            it can be also be divided by numbers 3 and 7.

        <li>
